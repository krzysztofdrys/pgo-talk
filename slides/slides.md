3. `curl -o cpu.pprof "http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30"` to profile your application,
4. `go build -pgo cpu.pprof .`
5. Deploy new profile to prod,

# Haversine formula

The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles. [from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)

Implemented by [github.com/jftuga/geodist](https://github.com/jftuga/geodist).

```go
var elPaso = geodist.Coord{Lat: 31.7619, Lon: 106.4850}
var stLouis = geodist.Coord{Lat: 38.6270, Lon: 90.1994}
miles, km = geodist.HaversineDistance(elPaso, stLouis)
fmt.Printf("[Haversine] El Paso to St. Louis:  %.3f m, %.3f km\n", miles, km)
```
